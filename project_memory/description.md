# Project Name #
PreLeave

## Description ##
* This is a full stack app that helps users to manage their trips from one location to another. 
* By taking users' start point, destination, and required arrival time, the app will examine the real-time traffic situation through API calls at a certain time (e.g., 1 hr and 30 min) before the required arrival time.
* Then, based on results from API calls, the app will arrange a most suitable transit plan (In this case, suggest to take a bus or Uber) to "ensure" that users can arrive on time. The time of both options are calculated based on the current traffic situation.

## User Personas ##
* People who often run into situation of being late to somewhere due to not checking traffic in advance.
* People who want to plan their trip earlier.
